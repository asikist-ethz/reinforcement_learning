# Reinforcement Learning
Reading material, code and examples based on the lectures of Agent-Based Modeling and Social System Simulation in ETH!

Each folder is a seperate project referring to one lecture. The structure of each project is:

```lecture/code```: a folder that contains the code relevant to the lecture, including any notebooks and their resources
```lecture/presentation```: The folder containing the corresponding presentation and any resources.
```lecture/reading_material```: Any extra reading material that is not trivial to find in the web.

Please us the example.ipynb files to get more information on how the code runs.
Furthermore, please check the documentation and the code to understand how it works.
If you need clarifications, please feel free to send on Slack.
In case you find any bugs, you can report them in the Repo as issues!

The content of the repo and the readme will be updated at times.
